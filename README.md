# Project Fëanor

Project Fëanor is an MSP430-based quadcopter that I designed for PHYS 319: Electronics Laboratory. It uses two main pieces of software: `ahab`, the flight controller written in C that runs on the MSP430, and `alqualonde`, a Python script for sending commands over UART from a laptop.
